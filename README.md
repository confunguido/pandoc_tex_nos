# Pandoc_tex_nos is a set of pandoc filters to number tables, figures, and equations from latex to word documents. It only works for that specific case. These filters are built upon pandoc-eq-nos v 1.4.3 [https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos) 

# I haven't tested these filters thoroughly, so use it at your own risk
